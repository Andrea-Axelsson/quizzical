## My process

### Built with

-Modern Web Technologies: This project is crafted using the latest standards in web development,
ensuring high performance and compatibility across various devices and browsers.

-React Framework: The core of the application is built using React,
providing a dynamic and responsive user experience. The usage of React's state
management and component-based architecture enables efficient rendering and interactive features.

-API Integration: The game integrates with the Open Trivia Database API,
providing a vast array of questions across different categories and difficulties.
This integration ensures a diverse and engaging quiz experience with updated content.

-Responsive Design: Adopting a mobile-first approach, the layout is responsive and
fluid across different screen sizes. The use of Flexbox ensures that elements are
well-structured and adaptable to various devices.

-Stylish Aesthetics: The application features a clean and modern UI, with custom CSS
properties and Google Fonts (Inter and Karla) enhancing the visual appeal. The design
is intuitive, making the quiz both enjoyable and easy to navigate.

-Interactive UI Elements: Custom radio buttons for quiz options, hover effects,
and dynamic score display contribute to an interactive and engaging user interface.

-Accessibility Considerations: Semantic HTML5 markup is used to structure the content,
promoting accessibility and SEO-friendliness.

### What I learned

This project, "Quizzical," was a fantastic journey into the depths of web application development,
significantly enhancing my skills and understanding of several key areas. Unlike my previous projects
where I primarily focused on vanilla javascript, this time I ventured into integrating external APIs
and managing application state using React.

One of the biggest takeaways from this project was mastering state management in React. Initially,
the concept of lifting state up and down components seemed daunting, but as I progressed, I realized
its power in creating dynamic and responsive applications. Implementing the quiz logic, such as tracking
user selections and scores, was a practical exercise in understanding state and effect hooks.

Integrating with the Open Trivia Database API was another significant aspect of my learning. Handling
API requests, managing response data, and dealing with asynchronous operations were crucial skills I developed.
This experience has opened up new possibilities for me in terms of building more interactive and content-rich web applications.

In summary, building "Quizzical" was a holistic learning experience. It honed my skills in React,
deepened my understanding of API integration, and expanded my capabilities in advanced CSS layouts.
I feel more confident in my ability to tackle complex web development challenges and am excited to
apply these learnings in future projects.

### Continued development

In future projects, I'm keen on deepening my understanding of React's capabilities, particularly in areas
like state management and component lifecycle methods. For "Quizzical," this means refining the way states
are managed across different components to enhance the user experience in a dynamic quiz environment.
I also plan to explore more sophisticated JavaScript functionalities, such as creating adaptive question
flows and incorporating real-time interactive elements, to add depth and engagement to the quiz experience.
